		How I started playing
		</h2>
			<p>
			I first started playing guitar when I was 9 years old. My older sister had been learning how to play guitar herself, and she inspired me to learn how to play myself. For christmas, my grandmother bought me my very own guitar to play, and I had a blast playing from the very beginning despite not knowing how to actually play the instrument.
			I started to teach myself simple songs using single notes, but quickly got tired of playing "easy" songs. Eventually I started taking guitar lessons, which greatly helped me to improve as a guitarist. I learned lots of music theory, like chords and scales- which are essential to playing guitar.

		Forming a band
		</h2>
			<p>After many years of practicing and playing at a couple of performances, I decided that I wanted to start my own band. I had made many attempts with one of my friends to start a band, but we never really took it too seriously or made any music.</p>
			<p>Eventually I put the idea on the back burner, and decided to just keep practicing and getting better solo. However, after what first started as a joke; a group of my friends and I spontaneously formed a band that ended up being official.</p>
			<p>We practiced nearly every day in my garage, and experimented with different genres in an attempt to craft our own style. Every practice session, we would attempt to make our own music but to no avail. After many hours of practice, we finally managed to make our own song. We played a single gig from the garage, for a party I was having at my house.</p>
			<p>After about a year and a half of practicing and recording, we gradually stopped meeting for practice until we eventually disbanded. Now adays, we'll occasionally meet to have a jam session.</p>
