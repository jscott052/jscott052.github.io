		Jaime Scott WEB110-01 Course Contract
		</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p> I, Jaime Scott agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2020, Web110-01 Internet/Web fundamentals with my instructor, D.I von Briesen. </p>
		<p> I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. </p>
		<p> I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. </p>
		<p> Signed: Jaime Gabriel-William Scott, 1/29/2020 </p>
		<h2>Workspace Setup</h2>
		<p>Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and cropped and sized the image appropriately. Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder.<p>
