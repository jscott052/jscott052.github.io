      <h4>Notes on the Fretboard</h4>
      <p>Learning the notes on the fretboard can be an intimidating task, but it's easier than it seems!</p>

        <p>Before learning the notes on the fretboard, you first need to understand how the notes flow on guitar.
        The notes move up the alphabet, starting at A and ending at G. Between each note you have a sharp or a flat,
        depending on which direction you moved. Between A and B, you have A#(sharp) or B flat. However, on the fretboard
        there are no sharps or flats between B and C or E and F.</p>
        <p>Starting from A and ending at G, the full note scale looks like this.</p>
        <p>A | A# | B | C | C# | D | D# | E | F | F# | G | G#</p>
        <p>After you reach G#, the notes loop back ground to A but in a higher pitch.</p>

        <p>The above figure is a diagram of the fretboard.</p>
        <p>The Low E string is at the bottom, and the High E string is at the top. The strings are named after which note they
        play in standard tuning. Without pressing down any frets, the low and high E string play out the E note. As you press down
        on the frets, you move up one position in the note scale. Using the above information, if you were to move to the 1st fret on
        either of the E strings, you would be playing an F note (Remember there is no E# on the guitar fretboard!).</p>
        <p>The rest of the strings follow this same pattern. The first fret on the A string plays an A#/B flat note, the second
        fret plays the B note, and so on.</p>
        <p>A helpful piece of information to remember is that on the twelth fret, the notes "reset" back to their original note.
        On the twelth fret, all of the strings will return to E A D G B E, just in a higher pitch!</p>
