      <h4>Parts of the Guitar</h4>
      <p>Before you start playing your guitar, you need to know all the parts and terminology of your instrument!</p>

        <h3>Guitar Anatomy 101</h3>
        <p>All Guitars are fundamentally built the same way. They all feature a long neck with multiple horizontal bars, or frets
        running down the neck. The strings start from the head, and run down the neck into the bridge. The head has multiple
        metal knobs, called tuning keys which are used to tune the instrument.</p>
        <p>Electric Guitars are much more intricate than acoustic guitars. Since they rely on electricity to amplify their sound,
        they have many more components built into them. The pickups are of the many extra components on an electric guitar. They are located where the soundhole would be located on an acoustic.
        They are magnetic and convert the sound vibrations into an electrical signal, which is then sent to the amplifier. Along with the pickups, comes the pickup selector switch, which
        allows you to select which pickup you want to use. Electric guitars also have volume and tone control knobs, and an output jack
        for the guitar cable.</p>
        <h3>Diving Deeper..</h3>
        <h4>Frets</h4>
        <p>Frets are the horizontal bars that run down the neck of your guitar. They start spread further apart, and as they go towards the end of the neck, are placed closer together.
        The higher up the neck you go, the higher pitch of note will be played.</p>
        <h4>Tuning Keys</h4>
        <p>The tuning knobs are used to tune each individual string on the guitar.</p>
        <h4>Position Markers</h4>
        <p>These are the dots or symbols that you normally see running down the neck of the guitar. The double dots indicates the twelth fret. It is very important to learn
        which fret position each of the markers indicates, as it will help you not to get lost around the neck.</p>
        <h4>Strings</h4>
        <p>Guitars generally have six strings. In standard tuning, they are tuned to E A D G B E, from top to bottom. It is crucial that you remember each string name by heart,
        and a good way of doing that is to remember this mnemonic. "Eddy Ate Dynamite Good Bye Eddy". It's a little dark, but it helped me to never forget it!</p>
